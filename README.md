This repository contains downloadable archives of BWA compatible with the Bioinformatics Toolbox for MATLAB.

# What is BWA?
BWA (Burrow-Wheeler Aligner) is a tool for mapping DNA sequences to a reference genome. This allows users to determine the genomic location of DNA fragments that are derived from a genome. This is a necessary first step in the analysis of many bioinformatics data sets, including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and DNase-seq.

The project is now maintained by Heng Li at Harvard University. For more details, visit the project news document at https://github.com/lh3/bwa/blob/master/NEWS.md.
